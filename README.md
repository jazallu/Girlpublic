# GirlApp 💕🎀

A swipe based social app that helps **college girls only** find **roommates**, **friends**, and a real community — without the chaos of Facebook groups

## 👯‍♀️ What It Does

• Swipe to discover other girls at your school  
• Match only if both users show interest  
• Chat unlocks after mutual approval  
• Create fun, expressive profiles using prompts, traits, interests, and photos  
• Safe, exclusive, and designed for girls who just want to find their people

## 🌸 Why It Matters

Finding genuine friends or roommates in college is hard  
Facebook groups are messy and random DMs feel awkward  
**GirlApp** makes the process intentional, fun, and built just for girls  
It’s like Bumble for roommates and friends — not dating

## 🛠 Tech Stack

• Built entirely in SwiftUI  
• Firebase for authentication, Firestore, and photo storage  
• Push notifications included  
• Gen Z friendly design with a blush pink aesthetic throughout
